# Ark Documentation Theme

I use this simple [Ark][] theme for generating project documentation, including documentation for Ark itself. It's clean, content-focused, and mobile-friendly.

It doesn't support index pages so it isn't suitable for blog-style sites.

## Includes

This theme supports the following include files:

* `menu`

  This file should contain a list of links.

* `footer`

  This file can contain a list of links or a paragraph of text. If this file
  is missing, the `menu` file will be reused in its place.
